# Advent of Code 2024 - ðŸŽ„ Reflection ðŸŽ„

Taking part in Advent of Code was a great experience. It gave me a chance to sharpen my problem-solving skills and practice working through algorithmic challenges under time pressure.

I chose Scala for this challenge since itâ€™s the language Iâ€™m most comfortable with right now, and I thought it would help me solve problems faster. That said, I didnâ€™t focus on writing clean, functional code this time. I leaned on things I usually avoid at work â€” like vars, mutable collections, whiles, and loopsâ€”just to keep things moving.

Iâ€™m excited to tackle it again next year and hopefully improve my approach and rankings! ðŸŽ‰
